HW1: A Dramatic Analysis

Description: This program takes in a text file of all of Shakespeare's words
with lengths of five and greater and sorts them based on how frequently
they appear. Words that share the same frequency are sorted alphabetically.
Then the program reads through the user's input file to output certain words
based on the indexes provided in the input file.

Files:
bard.cpp: Contains the main function for the program. Takes in the input, and prints to both the output file and cout.
linkedlist.cpp: Contains the implementations of the functions for the LinkedList class.
linkedlist.h: Contains the header for the LinkedList class.
Makefile: Used to compile the program.
README: Contains the description of the program. What you are currently reading.

Instructions: To build the program, type "make". To delete any compiler generated files,
run "make clean". To run the program, type "./bard <input.txt> <output.txt>" with the user
providing any input and output text files that they wish.
