HW 4: Six degrees of Kevin Bacon

Description: The following program takes in a list of movies and the actors that were
in them (scraped from IMDB) and takes in the names of two actors. The program will then
find the shortest path between the two actors based on other actors who starred in the same
movies as them. If the actors don't have a path between them or if one of the actors isn't
on the given list, a not present message is printed to the output instead.

Files:
sixdegrees.cpp: Contains all of the code for this program which consists of a main function and a shortest path function.
Makefile: Used to compile the program.
README: Contains the description of the program. What you are currently reading.

Instructions: To build the program, type "make". To delete any compiler generated files, run "make clean".
To run the program, type "./sixdegrees <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>".
